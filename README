priorities - group ratings for a list of priority items

Copyright (c) 2008 Kentfield School District

A ruby on rails 2.0 project.  Users sign up or log in and can then vote
their priorities on a prebuilt list of items, in this case line items
for our technology budget.  The list of items is imported into the (sqlite3)
database at migration time from the 'budget_items.csv' file located
in the db folder.
